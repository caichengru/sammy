The company?? primary revolving        credit facility has a maximum capacity of $1.5 billion and        matures in December 2011. As of December 31, 2009, there        were no outstanding borrowings under this facility. The company        also maintains a Euro-denominated credit facility with a maximum        capacity of approximately $435 million at December 31,        2009, which matures in January 2013. As of December 31,        2009, there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility.        As of December 31, 2008, there was $164 million        outstanding under this facility, which was repaid in 2009. The        company?? facilities enable the company to borrow funds on        an unsecured basis at variable interest rates, and contain        various covenants, including a maximum net-debt-to-capital        ratio. At December 31, 2009, the company was in compliance        with the financial covenants in these agreements.

', '        The company also maintains other credit arrangements, which        totaled $454 million at December 31, 2009 and        $409 million at December 31, 2008. Borrowings        outstanding under these facilities totaled $29 million at        December 31, 2009 and $24 million at December 31,        2008.    ', 'Leases', '        The company leases certain facilities and equipment under        capital and operating leases expiring at various dates. The        leases generally provide for the company to pay taxes,        maintenance, insurance and certain other    operating costs of the leased property. Most of the operating        leases contain renewal options. Operating lease rent expense was        $172 million in 2009, $161 million in 2008 and        $157 million in 2007.    ', 'Collaborative        Arrangements', '        On January 1, 2009, the company adopted a new accounting        standard related to collaborative arrangements, which was        required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented        for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective        date. The adoption of this new standard did not result in a        change to the company?? historical consolidated financial        statements.    ', '        In the normal course of business, Baxter enters into        collaborative arrangements with third parties. Certain of these        collaborative arrangements include joint operating activities        involving active participation by both partners, where both        Baxter and the other entity are exposed to risks and rewards        dependent on the commercial success of the activity. These        collaborative arrangements exist in all three of the        company?? segments, take a number of forms and structures,        principally pertain to the joint development and        commercialization of new products, and are designed to enhance        and expedite long-term sales and profitability growth.    ', '        The collaborative arrangements can broadly be grouped into two        categories: those relating to new product development, and those        relating to existing commercial products.    ', 'New        Product Development Arrangements', '        The company?? joint new product development and        commercialization arrangements generally provide that Baxter        license certain rights to manufacture, market or distribute a        specified technology or product under development. Baxter??        consideration for the rights generally consists of some        combination of up-front payments, ongoing R&D cost        reimbursements, royalties, and contingent payments relating to        the achievement of specified pre-clinical, clinical, regulatory        approval or sales milestones. Joint steering committees often        exist to manage the various stages and activities of the        arrangement. Control over the R&D activities may be shared        or may be performed by Baxter. Baxter generally controls the        commercialization phase, sometimes purchasing raw materials from        the collaboration partner.    ', '        During the development phase, Baxter?? R&D costs are        expensed as incurred. These costs may include R&D cost        reimbursements to the partner, as well as up-front and milestone        payments to the partner prior to the date the product receives        regulatory approval. Milestone payments made to the partner        subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as other        intangible assets and amortized to cost of sales over the        estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalty payments are        expensed as cost of sales when they become due and payable. Any        purchases of raw materials from the partner during the        development stage are expensed as R&D, while such purchases        during the commercialization phase are capitalized as inventory        and recognized as cost of sales when the related finished        products are sold. Baxter generally records the amount invoiced        to the third-party customer for the finished product as sales,        as Baxter is the principal and primary obligor in the        arrangement.    ', '        Payments to collaborative partners classified in cost of sales        were not significant in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Payments to        collaborative partners classified in R&D expense were 6%,        7% and 8% of total R&D expense in 2009, 2008 and 2007,        respectively. The payments principally related to the        development of tissue repair products, longer-acting forms of        blood clotting proteins to treat hemophilia and a home HD device.    ', 'Commercial        Product Arrangements', '        The company?? commercial product collaborative arrangements        generally provide for a sharing of manufacturing, marketing or        distribution activities between Baxter and the partner, along        with a sharing of the related profits. The nature and split of        the shared activities varies, sometimes split by type of        activity and sometimes split by geographic area.    ', '        The entity that invoices the third-party customer is generally        the principal and primary obligor in the arrangement and        therefore records the invoiced amount as a sale. Cost-sharing        payments are generally recorded in cost of sales. Baxter??        payments to partners under these types of arrangements were less        than 1% of total cost of sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007.    ', 'Other        Commitments and Contingencies', 'Joint        Development and Commercialization Arrangements', '        In addition to the new product development arrangements        discussed above, the company has entered into certain other        arrangements which include contingent milestone payments. At        December 31, 2009, the company?? unfunded milestone        payments associated with all of its arrangements totaled        $812 million. This total excludes any contingent royalties.        Based on the company?? projections, any contingent payments        made in the future will be more than offset over time by the        estimated net future cash flows relating to the rights acquired        for those payments. The majority of the contingent payments        relate to arrangements in the BioScience segment. Included in        the total are contingent milestone payments of $220 million        relating to arrangements entered into during 2008 and 2007 that        are discussed in Note 4. Aside from the items discussed in        Note 4, significant collaborations relate to the        development of hard and soft tissue-repair products to position        the company to enter the orthobiologic market, the development        of longer-acting forms of blood clotting proteins to treat        hemophilia A and other arrangements.    ', 'Indemnifications', '        During the normal course of business, Baxter makes indemnities,        commitments and guarantees pursuant to which the company may be        required to make payments related to specific transactions.        Indemnifications include: (i) intellectual property        indemnities to customers in connection with the use, sales or        license of products and services; (ii) indemnities to        customers in connection with losses incurred while performing        services on their premises; (iii) indemnities to vendors        and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence        or willful misconduct; and (iv) indemnities involving the        representations and warranties in certain contracts. In        addition, under Baxter?? Amended and Restated Certificate        of Incorporation, and consistent with Delaware General        Corporation Law, the company has agreed to indemnify its        directors and officers for certain losses and expenses upon the        occurrence of certain prescribed events. The majority of these        indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any        limitation on the maximum potential for future payments that the        company could be obligated to make. To help address some of        these risks, the company maintains various insurance coverages.        Based on historical experience and evaluation of the agreements,        the company does not believe that any significant payments        related to its indemnifications will result, and therefore the        company has not recorded any associated liabilities.    ', 'Legal        Contingencies', '        Refer to Note 11 for a discussion of the company??        legal contingencies.    ']   ['NOTE 11', '        LEGAL PROCEEDINGS', '        Baxter is involved in product liability, patent, commercial, and        other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of the        company?? business. The company records a liability when a        loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably        estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a        range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate, the        minimum amount in the range is accrued. If a loss is not        probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no        liability is recorded.    ', '        Baxter has established reserves for certain of the matters        discussed below. The company is not able to estimate the amount        or range of any loss for certain of the legal contingencies for        which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already        reserved. While the liability of the company in connection with        the claims cannot be estimated with any certainty and although        the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these        matters could have a significant impact on the company??        results of operations and cash flows for that period, the        outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a        material adverse effect on the company?? consolidated        financial position. While the company believes that it has valid        defenses in these matters, litigation is inherently uncertain,        excessive verdicts do occur, and the company may in the future        incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of        claims.    ', '        In addition to the matters described below, the company remains        subject to other potential administrative and legal actions.        With respect to regulatory matters, these actions may lead to        product recalls, injunctions to halt manufacture and        distribution, and other restrictions on the company??        operations and monetary sanctions. With respect to intellectual        property, the company may be exposed to significant litigation        concerning the scope of the company?? and others??n       rights. Such litigation could result in a loss of patent        protection or the ability to market products, which could lead        to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect        future results of operations.    ', 'Patent        Litigation', 'Sevoflurane        Litigation', '        Since 2000, Baxter?? generic sevoflurane has been the        subject of several patent infringement actions initiated by        Abbott Laboratories and Central Glass Company. The initial        lawsuit in the United States was resolved in Baxter?? favor        in 2007 by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit??        decision that the asserted patent was invalid. In 2009, a        lawsuit filed in Japan was also resolved in Baxter?? favor        by the appellate court?? determination that Baxter??        generic sevoflurane did not infringe the Japanese patent at        issue.    ', '        Related actions remain pending in the U.S. and Colombia. A        patent infringement action is pending in the U.S.D.C. for the        Northern District of Illinois on a second patent owned by Abbott        and Central Glass. In September 2009, the District Court granted        summary judgment of non-infringement in favor of Baxter. Abbott        has requested reconsideration of this ruling. In 2007, Abbott        brought a patent infringement action against Baxter in the Cali        Circuit Court of Colombia based on a Colombian counterpart        patent, and obtained an injunction preliminarily prohibiting the        approval of Baxter?? generic sevoflurane in Colombia during        the pendency of the infringement suit. In May 2008, the Court        issued a decision maintaining the injunction, but suspending it        during an appeal of the Court?? decision, which appeal is        pending.    ', 'Peritoneal        Dialysis Litigation', '        In October 2006, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, a direct        wholly-owned subsidiary of Baxter, and DEKA Products Limited        Partnership (DEKA) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against        Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. and Fresenius USA, Inc.        The complaint alleges that Fresenius??sale of the Liberty        Cycler peritoneal dialysis systems and related disposable items        and equipment infringes nine U.S. patents, which are owned        by Baxter or exclusively licensed in the peritoneal dialysis        field to Baxter from DEKA. The case is pending in the U.S.D.C.        for the Northern District of California with a trial anticipated        in mid-2010.    ', 'Hemodialysis        Litigation', '        Since April 2003, Baxter has been pursuing a patent infringement        action against Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. for        infringement of certain Baxter patents. The patents cover        Fresenius??2008K hemodialysis instrument. In 2007, the        court entered judgment in Baxter?? favor holding the        patents valid and infringed, and a jury assessed damages at        $14 million for past sales only. On April 4, 2008, the        U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of California granted        Baxter?? motion for permanent injunction, granted        Baxter?? request for royalties on Fresenius??sales of        the 2008K hemodialysis machines during a nine-month transition        period before the permanent injunction took effect, and granted        a royalty on disposables. On September 10, 2009, the        appellate court affirmed Fresenius??liability for        infringing valid claims of Baxter?? main patent,        invalidated certain claims of other patents, and remanded the        case to the district court to finalize the scope of the        injunction and the amount of damages owed to Baxter. In November        2009, the appellate court denied Fresenius??petition for        re-hearing of the appeal. In January 2010, Fresenius consented        to reentry of the injunction and a hearing on the royalty rate        is expected to be set for the second quarter of 2010.    ', 'Other', '        In October 2004, a purported class action was filed in the        U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of Illinois against Baxter        and its current Chief Executive Officer and then current Chief        Financial Officer and their predecessors for alleged violations        of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as        amended. Plaintiff alleges that these defendants, along with the        Administrative and Investment Committees of the company??        401(k) plans, breached their fiduciary duties to the plan        participants by offering Baxter common stock as an investment        option in each of the plans during the period of January 2001 to        October 2004. In March 2006, the trial court certified a class        of plan participants who elected to acquire Baxter common stock        through the plans between January 2001 and the present. In April        2008, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit denied        Baxter?? interlocutory appeal and upheld the trial        court?? denial of Baxter?? motion to dismiss. On        September 28, 2009, the trial court partially granted        Baxter?? motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing        claims related to the 2004 time-frame. Fact discovery has been        completed in this matter and expert discovery is proceeding. A        trial date is currently scheduled for April 2010.    ', '        On October 12, 2005 the United States filed a complaint in        the U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of Illinois to effect the        seizure of COLLEAGUE and SYNDEO infusion pumps that were on hold        in Northern Illinois. Customer-owned pumps were not affected. On        June 29, 2006, Baxter Healthcare Corporation entered into a        Consent Decree for Condemnation and Permanent Injunction with        the United States to resolve this seizure litigation. Additional        third-party claims may be filed in connection with the COLLEAGUE        matter. In September 2009, the company received a subpoena from        the Office of the United States Attorney of the Northern        District of Illinois requesting production of documents relating        to the COLLEAGUE infusion pump. The company is fully cooperating        with the request.

The complaints attempt to state a claim        for class action relief and in some cases demand treble damages.

In June 2008, a number of these federal        cases were    consolidated in the U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of Ohio        for pretrial case management under the Multi District Litigation        rules. A trial date for the first of these cases is scheduled        for early 2011.

', '        The company is a defendant, along with others, in less than a        dozen lawsuits which allege that Baxter and other defendants        manipulated product reimbursements by, among other things,        reporting artificially inflated average wholesale prices for        Medicare and Medicaid eligible drugs. The cases have been        consolidated for pretrial purposes before the U.S.D.C. for the        District of Massachusetts. In April 2008, the court        preliminarily approved a class settlement resolving Medicare        Part B claims and independent health plan claims against        Baxter and others, which had previously been reserved for by the        company. Final approval of this settlement is expected in the        first quarter of 2010. Baxter has also resolved a number of        other cases brought by state attorneys general and other        plaintiffs. A small number of lawsuits against Baxter brought by        relators, state attorneys general and New York entities remain        which seek unspecified damages, injunctive relief, civil        penalties, disgorgement, forfeiture and restitution. Various        state and federal agencies are conducting civil investigations        into the marketing and pricing practices of Baxter and others        with respect to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. These        investigations may result in additional cases being filed.    ', '        Baxter currently is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and        subject to additional claims brought by individuals who have        hemophilia and their families, all seeking damages for injuries        allegedly caused by anti-hemophilic factor concentrates VIII or        IX derived from human blood plasma (factor concentrates)        processed by the company and other acquired entities from the        late 1970s to the mid-1980s. The typical case or claim alleges        that the individual was infected with the HIV or HCV virus by        factor concentrates that contained one or both viruses. None of        these cases involves factor concentrates currently processed by        the company. Baxter and other defendants have announced a        settlement offer with respect to these claims. The fully        reserved settlement is contingent on receiving acceptance from a        significant percentage of the claimants by early 2010.    ']
